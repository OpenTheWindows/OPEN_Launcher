# OPEN [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OpenTheWindows/OPEN_Launcher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OpenTheWindows/OPEN_Launcher)

OpenTheWindow games project.

1.  Angular2 
2.  Electron 
3.  Express (node backend server)
4.  Jasmine (unit tests) + Karma (test runner)
5.  Protractor (end to end testing)
6.  Webpack

## File Structure
Component approach is used. 
This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. 
A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. 
Here's how it looks:
```

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v4.1.x`+ and NPM `2.14.x`+

Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install --global`:
* `webpack` (`npm install --global webpack`)
* `webpack-dev-server` (`npm install --global webpack-dev-server`)
* `karma` (`npm install --global karma-cli`)
* `protractor` (`npm install --global protractor`)
* `typings` (`npm install --global typings`)
* `typescript` (`npm install --global typescript`)
* `electron-packager` (`npm install --global electron-packager`)

## Installation
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies
* `typings install` to install necessary typings
* `npm start` to start the app on [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm start` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000` (or if you prefer IPv6, if you're using `express` server, then it's `http://[::1]:3000/`).

## Building the exe file using electron
Electron can be used with any framework, so once Electron is set in place, we simply create the Angular 2 app as we would for the web.
The Electron configuration is contained in `./main.js`.

### Important 
Set the environment variable to 'prod' in `./backend/env.js`.

To build application exe file for win32 x64 run the following commands:
```bash
# first create the dist folder 
npm run build

# than create the .exe
npm run pack
```

## Other commands
### server
```bash
# development
npm run server
# production
npm run build:prod
npm run server:prod
```

### run tests
```bash
npm run test
```
### watch and run our tests
```bash
npm run watch:test
```
### run end-to-end tests
```bash
# make sure you have your server running in another terminal
npm run e2e
```

### run webdriver (for end-to-end)
```bash
npm run webdriver:update
npm run webdriver:start
```

## Use latest TypeScript compiler
TypeScript 1.7.x includes everything you need. Make sure to upgrade, even if you installed TypeScript previously.
```
npm install --global typescript
```
## Use a TypeScript-aware editor
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 10](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)

# Typings
> When you include a module that doesn't include Type Definitions inside of the module you need to include external Type Definitions with Typings
## Use latest Typings module
```
npm install --global typings
```
## Custom Type Definitions
When including 3rd party modules you also need to include the type definition for the module
if they don't provide one within the module. You can try to install it with typings
```
typings install node --save
```
If you can't find the type definition in the registry we can make an ambient definition in
this file for now. For example
```typescript
declare module "my-module" {
  export function doesSomething(value: string): string;
}
```
If you're prototyping and you will fix the types later you can also declare it as type any
```typescript
declare var assert: any;
```
If you're importing a module that uses Node.js modules which are CommonJS you need to import as
```typescript
import * as _ from 'lodash';
```
